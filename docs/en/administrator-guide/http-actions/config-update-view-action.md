# VIEW UPDATE CONFIG

## View config api
View the current config by key.

```
curl -X GET http://host:port/api/config?key={key}
```

If the key does not exist, directly return an error.
```
{
    "status" : "BAD",
    "msg" : "xxxxxxx"
}
```

If api access successful, return success.
```
{
    "status" : "OK",
    "msg" : "success",
    "key" : "{key}",
    "value" : "{value}",
    "type" : "bool/int/double/string", 
    "modifiable" : true
}
```

## Dynamic update config api
Set variables through key and value

```
curl -X POST http://host:port/api/update_config?{key}={value}
```

If the key does not exist or the update fails, return an error directly
```
{
    "status" : "BAD",
    "msg" : "xxxxxxx"
}
```

If the update is successful, return success.
```
{
    "status" : "OK",
    "msg" : "success"
}
```

## Dynamic update config rules

You can refer to the be configuration item document or refer to the variable configured in the config.h source code. The beginning of m indicates that a variable can be dynamically modified.
